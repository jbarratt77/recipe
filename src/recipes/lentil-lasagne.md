# Lasagne (Noun)  
## Las-argh-neigh  
### As in `dish out that las-argh-neigh and stfu mom.`  

### Ingredients:  
- 200gees ðŸ¤˜ red lentils
- 1 massive brown onion (or two small, mix it up and throw in 1 red and 1 brown to keep it diverse)
- Fuck tons of garlic (3 phat cloves, donâ€™t be a little bitch)
- 1 large carrot (or 2 midgets)
- 2 x tins chopped tomatoes
- 2 tbs tomato purÃ©e 
- Salt and pepper to season
- Basil as fresh as the prince of bell air
- Wholemeal/lentil lasagne sheets
- Grated cheese to top (amount dependent on level of stress felt that day)

### Fo the white sauce:  
- 500ml almond milk
- 50g butter
- 50g wholemeal flour 

### Method:  
1. Soak the lentils overnight in a cool bath of fragrant water; light some candles
2. Preheat oven to 200
3. Chop the onion, garlic and onions and elegantly scatter in a pan; allow to soften (but not so soft they canâ€™t stand up for themselves in a fight)
4. Disperse the tinned tomatoes, lentils and purÃ©e into the veg; stir stir stir, simmer simmer simmer - do not be startled as local wildlife gathers at the window to enjoy the delicious smell filling the room (but donâ€™t look the deer directly in the eye as it will interpret you as a threat)
5. Season simmering sauce with the vitality of Freddy Mercury (do NOT be shy with your seasoning)
6. Add Phresh basil 
7. Now make the white sauce; melt the butter in a pan and add the flour; keep stirring until it makes a rue; google wtf a rue looks like (itâ€™s basically a paste); at the point of rue formation, add the milk a little at a time until youâ€™ve got a sauce. Should take about 10 minutes, give or take the internet connection
8. Once the sauce (the red one, not the white one) has been simmering for a good half an hour (from the point of softening the onions), itâ€™s time to build the lasagne
9. It goes in this order (do NOT deter from the traditional las-argh-neigh building technique or the entire country of Italy will implode): sauce, las-argh-neigh sheets, white sauce, sauce, las-argh-neigh sheet, white sauce etc - in our white dishes, you can fit 3 las-argh-neigh sheets on each layer and build 3 layers in height. 
10. Then sprinkle on the cheese in an elaborate and zealous frenzy. 
11. Stick it in the oven for 35-40 minutes
